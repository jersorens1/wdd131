        <h2>What are UTVs?</h2>
        <p>Utility Task Vehicles (UTVs), also known as side-by-sides, are versatile, 
            off-road vehicles designed for a variety of work and recreational activities. 
            They are similar to ATVs (All-Terrain Vehicles) but typically larger and can 
            accommodate multiple passengers.
        </p>
        <h3>Features and Design</h3>
        <p>UTVs usually have side-by-side seating for two to six passengers, hence the nickname
            "side-by-sides." They often come with seat belts and roll cages for enhanced safety. 
            UTVs are powered by gasoline or diesel engines, and electric models are also available. 
            They typically feature automatic transmissions, though manual options exist. Most UTVs 
            come with a rear cargo bed, similar to a small pickup truck, which can be used to carry 
            tools, equipment, and other loads. Some models have the capability to tow trailers, 
            further enhancing their utility. Many UTVs offer selectable 2WD, 4WD, and even 4WD with 
            differential lock to handle various terrains. They feature robust suspension systems and 
            large, rugged tires designed for off-road conditions.
